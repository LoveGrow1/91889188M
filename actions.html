        <h4>Invite your partner into decision-making processes:</h4>
        <p>Begin to involve your partner in significant decisions more actively. Acknowledge her opinions and ensure she feels heard and considered. You may face challenges if decisions take longer or result in disagreements, but remember, the journey is just as important as the destination in joint decisions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-box">
        <h4>Cultivate a safe environment for expressing desires:</h4>
        <p>Encourage your partner to share her wants and needs without fear of negative reactions. This might require patience and conscious effort to react with understanding and kindness, even if her desires are different from yours.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-box">
        <h4>Celebrate your relationship milestone:</h4>
        <p>As you've been dating for 69 months, consider planning a special date or activity that represents your shared interests and memories. This act can show how much you value your relationship's longevity and the journey you've had together. This can be challenging in the rush of daily life, but it's an investment in your relationship's future.</p>
